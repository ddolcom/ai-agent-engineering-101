"""Round 3 restock hook (ddolcom: deep stock where the market's money is, then what my customers buy).

    python restock.py --state .market

The kit runs this every 60 s in Round 3 and buys what the last printed line asks for: {"buy": [{"sku", "qty"}, ...]}.
Buyers only see a shop for an order if it stocks that order's category, so the shop keeps one unit in as many
cheap categories as it can, refills what sold first, keeps two where it sold twice, and stops buying food that
rotted unsold. Memory: restock_memory.json in the agent folder (what we held, what sold, what expired).

Customers first (customers.py): buyers who settled with my shop are remembered from the public ledger, with
what they buy anywhere; their favourite categories are stocked before anything else, with more units.
Then what the whole market buys: categories by their share of settled deals on the ledger, more units for a
bigger share; once the market has MARKET_DATA deals, categories nobody bought are not stocked.
Money first: goods categories with VALUE_FOCUS of the market's sales value (deals x list price) are stocked by SKU,
not by category: the FOCUS_SKUS SKUs with the most value that the balance can carry, each to a target set by how
often it sells (focus_want). They come before all others, within FOCUS_SPEND of the spendable cash.
Categories with under MIN_VALUE of the value are not stocked unless the shop already sold there.
Cheap first: until the shop has CHEAP_PHASE sales, only categories and SKUs up to CHEAP_MAX_LIST, except hot ones.
Supply opens every 20 minutes for 3 minutes; outside a window the run only learns and buys nothing, because
the kit would wait 90 s per line and could miss the window itself.
