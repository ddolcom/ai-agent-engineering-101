"""Round 3 seller (ddolcom, from the kit's starter): sells from the stock the kit keeps in $MARKET_DIR/inventory.json,
behind A2A v1.0.

    python seller_r3.py --port 9301

The code decides every price (a concession schedule from the list price down to a floor), so a reply never waits
on the model. The harness only polishes the wording of a reply, and the code's own sentence is used when it is slow.
Every receipt names the unit, claims its true grade and keeps the market's certificate; goods of grade A and B carry
a break warranty and food says how many hours it has left. Food near its date may go below cost (NEAR_EXPIRY).
